Wine Quality Assessment Using Deep Learning

![](data/winary.jpg)

Vinho Verde vines grow in fertile, granite soil, up in the cold, rainy, Portugal Northwest. The region stretches from the northern border with Spain down to the city of Porto. There are nine sub-regions named after rivers or towns: Monção, Melgaço, Lima, Basto, Cávado, Ave, Amarante, Baião, Sousa and Paiva. Vinho Verde wines are known for high acidity, lower alcohol levels, and mild carbonation making them a perfect choice for hot summer days. The majority of Vinho Verde wines are white and come from six grapes: Azal, Arinto, Alvarinho, Avesso, Loureiro, and Trajadura. Most of them are dry wines with a fruity aroma. Due to cold and rainy weather, the red wines are much less common. The three red grape varieties are Vinhão, Espadeiro, and Padeiro. The red Vinho Verde wines are more acidic and less fruity than white ones. 

We decided to test whether AI can predict the quality of the wine based on physicochemical characteristics using the Vinho Verde white and red wine datasets.
